## Key Features

-   üíª **Lightweight & Efficient:** Sits quietly in your system tray without hogging resources. Features a "Dynamic Update Rate" that automatically reduces update frequency when the network is idle to conserve CPU and battery life.

-   ‚ú® **Native Look & Feel:** Designed to blend in perfectly with the Windows 10/11 UI. Includes smart detection for light and dark taskbar themes to ensure text is always visible.

-   üöÄ **Intelligent & Adaptive Positioning:** The widget finds the empty space next to your system tray and automatically shifts to make room for new icons, ensuring it never overlaps.

-   **Seamless OS Integration:** Behaves like a native OS component.
    -   Hides instantly with the **auto-hiding taskbar**.
    -   Hides instantly when you use a **fullscreen application**.

-   üìà **Smart Network Monitoring:**
    -   Accurate by Default: The "Auto" mode is now the default and intelligently identifies your main internet connection, providing a true speed reading by ignoring noise from VPNs and virtual adapters.
    -   Clear Interface Selection: A new, intuitive radio-button system in the settings makes it effortless to switch between Auto, All, or Selected interfaces.

-   üé® **Total Visual Customization:**
    -   **Free Move Mode:** Unlock the widget and place it anywhere on your screen.
    -   **Optional Mini-Graph:** Display a real-time graph of recent activity directly on the widget, with adjustable opacity.

    -   **Text & Font:** Fine-tune the font family, size, weight, and text alignment (left/center/right).
    -   **Units:** Choose between an automatic unit (B/s, KB/s, MB/s) or a fixed `Mbps` display.
    -   **Precision:** Control the number of decimal places and choose to always show them for a uniform look.

-   üìä **Detailed & Intelligent History Graph:** Double-click the widget to open a powerful and insightful history graph.
    -   **Always-Readable Smart Scale:** A dynamic logarithmic scale lets you see fine-grained detail in low-level traffic while still clearly showing massive download spikes.
    -   **Per-Interface Filtering:** Isolate the speed history for any specific network adapter on your system (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN, etc.).
    -   **Safe & Efficient Data Management:** Adjust data retention with an accidental-deletion grace period, while the database is automatically cleaned and optimized to save space.
    -   **Easy Data Export:** Export raw data to a `.csv` file for spreadsheet analysis or save the graph itself as a high-quality `.png` image.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

> **A Note on System UI Integration:** To ensure a clean and predictable experience, NetSpeedTray is designed to integrate seamlessly with core Windows UI. Due to how Windows layers its system menus, elements like the Start Menu and Action Center will always appear on top.
>
> Instead of being awkwardly covered, the widget will gracefully hide when these menus are active and **reappear instantly** the moment they are closed. This behavior is intentional and ensures the widget feels like a polished, non-intrusive part of the operating system.
